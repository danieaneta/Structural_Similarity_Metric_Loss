# Structural_Similarity_Metric_Loss
Translating and implementing Structural Similarity Metric Loss from research to code. Exploring the equation as a simple program using numpy, then adding in optimization methods. Core functionality will showcase disparity loss as python code using Numpy, CUDA programming and PyTorch.
